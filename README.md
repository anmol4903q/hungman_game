# ðŸŽ® Hangman Game (Python)

A classic Hangman game made using Python â€” with a twist of emotion and persistence!

## ðŸš€ About the Game
This is a terminal-based Hangman game where the player tries to guess the hidden word (a country name) letter by letter. With each wrong guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. If the full man gets drawn before the word is guessed â€” the game ends.

### ðŸŽ¯ Features:
- Random country name selection
- Lives and attempt tracking
- ASCII art to visualize the hanging man step-by-step
- Win/Lose messages
- Option to retry after the game ends

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- `while` loops, `for` loops
- `if`/`else` conditionals
- String and list manipulation
- ASCII art display
- Game logic and user interaction
- Handling retries and edge cases

## ðŸ’¬ My Struggle Story

> This project has been my **toughest challenge so far** in my Python learning journey.  
>  
> I worked on it for almost **12+ hours**, fixing bugs, understanding `while` loops, tracking guesses, and figuring out how to update the dashes dynamically.  
>  
> There were moments I genuinely felt like quitting Python â€” but I kept pushing. I asked questions, broke the code down, and didnâ€™t stop until it worked the way I imagined it.  
>  
> Looking back now, I'm proud that I didn't give up â€” this game is a **symbol of growth, patience, and passion**.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Play
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Guess the letters of the secret word (a country name).
3. Every wrong guess brings the hangman closer to being drawn.
4. Guess the word before the man is completely hung!
5. After the game ends, choose to play again or exit.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
- Add a GUI using Tkinter
- Scoreboard or win/lose tracker
- Add difficulty levels

## ðŸ›  Built With
- Python 3.x
- ASCII Art (for the visuals)

## ðŸ™Œ Special Thanks
To myself â€” for not quitting, even when it got really frustrating.  
And to the Python community & mentors that keep encouraging me to grow step-by-step.
